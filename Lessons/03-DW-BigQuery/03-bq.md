## Module 3 - Data Warehouse and BQ

### OLAP vs OLTP
OLTP means a Database Normalized for Essential operations, where OLAP stands for Analytical, usually OLAP databases are Denormalized databases that can contains data from some OLTP source.
OLTP Example: Customer Personnel, clerks, online shoppers
OLAP: Knowledge workers such as data analysts, business analysts and executives 

### Data Warehouse
Usually is a OLAP solution, can contain, Meta Data, Summary Data and Raw Data.
Warhouses can be used to create Data Marts like a Operational System goes to a Warehouse that goes to Marts such as Purchasing, Sales, Inventory

### Big Query
Data Warehouse - Serverless, scalability and high availability, can be used with Machine learning and business intelligence

### Cost?
On Demand - 1 TB -> $5
Flat Rate -> 100 Slots -> $2.000/month = 400 TB

### Partition and Clustering
Partition can be a column used to create a table like creation_date, it helps to reduce cost operation because we process less data.
**TIP: find how many rows/partition you can see with: database.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS**

Clustering its similar to partition but works in a way to help reduce costs and improve perfomance on queries, it aggregate data by one or more column transforming into blocks that should be often used on queries.

**PARTITIONS**
Time-unit Column / Ingestion Time
Limit: 4000

**CLUSTERING**
Columns you specify are used to colocate related data, ORDER is important
Improves: Filter and Agg Queries
Tables with Less than 1GB don't show significant improvment
Limit: 4 Columns

BigQuery does Automatic Reclustering everytime there is new data. NO COST

### Best Practices
Avoid SELECT *
Price your queries before running
Use Clustered or partitioned
Use streaming inserts with caution
Materialize query results in stages
