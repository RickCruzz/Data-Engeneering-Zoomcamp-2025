### What will you learn in this workshop?
In this workshop, you’ll learn the core skills required to build and manage data pipelines:

    How to build robust, scalable, and self-maintaining pipelines.
    Best practices, like built-in data governance, for ensuring clean and reliable data flows.
    Incremental loading techniques to refresh data quickly and cost-effectively.
    How to build a Data Lake with dlt.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to build data pipelines like a senior data engineer — quickly, concisely, and with best practices baked in.

## DLT VS DBT
DLT is for data ingestion, DBT is focused on transformation.
Two different pats of the Data Pipeline.

Handle Paginations, Auth and other variables more easly and in a concise way.
You don't need to write a bunch of code to extract from multiple pages.
